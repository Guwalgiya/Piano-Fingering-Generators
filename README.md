# Piano-Fingering-Generators
Research Project - Piano Fingering Generators

August 2016 - December 2017: Hongzhao Guan's Research Project at GTCMT (Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology)

                             A rule-based approach was created based on three piano pedagogy books I read.
                             A dataset (Czerny 599) with labeld fingering can be found in this repository. 
                             
December 2016 - August 2017: Hongzhao Guan's Research Project at GTCMT

                             An HMM (Hidden Markov Model) approach was created.
                             
August 2017 - December 2017: Hongzhao Guan and Zhao Yan's Group Project for CS7643 (Deep Learning)

                             An LSTM approach was created.
                             The 599 dataset was augumented.
                             
December 2017 -     Current:  We are trying to make this project a publication.
